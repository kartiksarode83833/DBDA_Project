Video Script for Census Income Prediction Project
Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)
[Opening Scene: Presenter in front of a computer with the dataset on the screen]
Hello everyone! Welcome to my presentation on the Census Income Prediction project. In this project, we aim to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year based on various demographic factors. This is a fascinating application of machine learning that can provide insights into income distribution and help identify trends in socioeconomic status.
Data Overview (0:30 - 1:30)
[Cut to: Screen share of the dataset in a Jupyter Notebook]
Letâ€™s start by loading the dataset. We use the Pandas library to read our CSV file, which contains various features such as age, education, work class, occupation, and more.
[Show df.head() and df.info() outputs]
Here, you can see the first few rows of the dataset and some basic information about it, including the data types and number of entries.
[Show df.isna().sum() and df.describe().T outputs]
Next, we check for missing values and get a statistical summary of our dataset. We find some missing values represented by question marks, which we will address shortly.
Data Cleaning (1:30 - 2:30)
[Cut to: Code snippets for replacing '?']
To clean the data, we replace the '?' in the Workclass, Occupation, and Native Country columns with the mode of each column. This ensures we have no missing values.
[Show value counts for cleaned columns]
After cleaning, we can see the updated value counts for these columns, which now reflect a more accurate representation of our data.
Feature Encoding (2:30 - 3:00)
[Cut to: Code snippets for label encoding]
Next, we perform label encoding on categorical variables. This step converts our categorical data into numerical format, making it suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Now, our dataset is ready for modeling, with all categorical variables encoded.
Data Splitting (3:00 - 3:30)
[Cut to: Code snippets for splitting data into X and y]
We split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y), which is our income classification. Then, we divide the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.
Model Training (3:30 - 4:30)
[Cut to: Code snippets for model training functions]
Now, we train several machine learning models to predict income. We use Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, CatBoost, AdaBoost, and XGBoost.
[Show the models list and briefly explain each]
Each model has its strengths, and we will evaluate their performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Model Evaluation (4:30 - 5:00)
[Cut to: Code snippets for model evaluation]
After training, we evaluate each model and compile the results into a DataFrame.
[Show the evaluation results]
We can see how each model performed. For instance, the Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of over 85%, which is quite promising!
Conclusion (5:00 - 5:30)
[Cut back to the presenter]
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting income levels based on demographic data. By cleaning the data, encoding categorical variables, and training multiple models, we can derive meaningful insights.
